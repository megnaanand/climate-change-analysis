# Climate Change Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project explores the correlation between environmental changes and the rise in global temperatures from 1880 to 2020. Utilizing NASA Climate Change datasets, we analyze variables such as global CO2 and Methane levels, global temperature, ocean warming, ice sheets sea levels, and Arctic sea ice levels. Our aim is to uncover patterns and predict future trends in global warming and environmental changes through extensive data visualization techniques.

## Setting Up in Google Colab
To set up and run this project in Google Colab:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open Google Colab and use `!git clone [repository link]` to clone the project repository.

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Run `!pip install [libraries]` to install necessary Python packages.

3. **Run the Notebooks**:
   - Open the provided Jupyter Notebooks and run each cell to reproduce the analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
Our preprocessing steps include cleaning, combining datasets, addressing missing values, and accounting for outliers to ensure data quality.

## Analysis Methodology
We employ various data visualization models, such as heatmaps and line plots, to analyze correlations. The methodology includes transformation steps tailored to highlight specific patterns in climate change variables.

## Insights and Predictive Modeling
The report details insights from the analysis, including unusual trends, and discusses the predictive modeling approach for forecasting temperature changes. You can find the report [here](https://github.com/megnaanand/climate-change-analysis/files/14826394/ECE_225A_Final_Project.2.pdf).
